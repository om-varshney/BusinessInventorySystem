# Business Inventory System

Welcome to our Business Inventory Management System. This is a product where Business Admins get to see and manage
interactions with their users. For our project, we have built a secured application that can simplify the process of
making and maintaining a business inventory.

As a user you get to buy your favourite products and as an admin you get to monitor your inventory
and see what the users are buying. We have built this project in Java and powered it using MySQL. Through this
we hope to demonstrate a strong understanding of Database concepts as well as a hold on Object oriented programming.
